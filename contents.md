PWM Group (formerly Programming with Maurya) began as a small peer-to-peer learning group where developers shared knowledge, asked questions, and helped each other grow. Over time, as our community matured and our projects evolved, we realized the need to turn this energy into action — to build things together that solve real-world problems.

That’s how PWM Group transformed into what it is today — a builder-first tech collective focused on launching impactful platforms for developers, AI engineers, and enterprises. From open-source tools to AI-powered SaaS platforms, PWM is now a launchpad for products, ideas, and community-led innovation.

We’ve moved beyond just learning — we now build, ship, and grow together.
